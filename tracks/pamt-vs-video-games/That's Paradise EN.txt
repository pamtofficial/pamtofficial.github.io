That's paradise since the first time
I saw you standing there,
But it seems so long ago now, yeah.

That's paradise, but no map can
Show us how to get there.
Come on, oh, baby, planet of love.

We made our way out of long,
La-long darkness, and we've
Made it this far.
Such a long round, so let's go!

Shining all the way,
Oh, we're on our own path now.
We can take it anywhere
That we want to go, HOO HOO! 

Sweet shart of love,
Oh, can you hear it, too?
I am always looking at you,
My sweet girl.

And I see you right there,
Smiling back at me too! WAAAAAOOOOOOOO!
