      <h2>welcoim 2 our merch page</h2>
      <p>we dont actoally sell merchandise, (or anything at all). thats rigt... its up to <b>YOU</b> to produce the merch! we create the desings and <b>YOU</b> print and or modify it to you're Hart's content! you can put it on anything!! from tshirts to bumber stickers to coughie mugs to buttons! all we ask is you add a link to our website if it is convieninent to do so.</p>
      <p>we recommend the free tool <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/" class="mega">inkscape</a> (&lt;-- clic 2 download) for your vector editing needs butyou can use anything</p>
      <p>have a design you want to be featured in the official merch folder? <a href="about.html">contact us on our socials or throiugh email!!</a> we will credit you if you want</p>
      <h2>what shold i look for?!</h2>
      <p>first of all go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pamtofficial/pamtofficial.github.io/tree/main/merch">merch folder on our github page</a> (this is a short term solution, we will have a proper merch page sooner or later)</p>
      <p>you will see 2 folders.</p>
      <p>the <b>designs</b> folder is for actual designs, like funny phrases and all that</p>
      <p>the <b>components</b> folder is for design elements (or what music execs would call "brand assets"), like the logo, or People Against Music Timmy's head. you can print these as they are or remix them into your own designs</p>
      <p>each design has its own folder, so you can use it on both light and dark backgrounds</p>
      <p>once you have chosen a design, click on it and it will show up in github. right click your image and click save as.</p>
      <p>need to convert something? there are instructions in the root of the merch folder. there is also the internet</p>
      <h2>this will be you oce you srart making merch</h2>
