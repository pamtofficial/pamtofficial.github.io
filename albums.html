      I've learned to slam on the brake
      Before I even turn the key
      Before I make the mistake
      Oh yeah

      Step out, step out of the sun
      If you keep getting burned
      Step out, step out of the sun
      Because you've burned, because you're hurt

      On the outside, always looking in
      Will I ever see more than I've always seen?
      'Cause I'm punch, punch, punching on the glass
      I'm walfing through the window
      I try to speak, but nobody can hear
      So I wait around for the answer to appear
      While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
      I'm waving through the window, oh
      Can anybody see, is anybody staring back at me?

      We start with stars in our eyes
      We start believing that we belong
      But always sun not all rise
      And no one tells you where you went wrong

      Step out, step out of the sun
      If you keep getting burned
      Step out, step out of the sun
      Because you've learned, because you've learned

      On the outside, always looking in
      Will I ever be more than I've always been?
      'Cause I'm rap, rap, rapping on the glass
      Waffle through a window
      I try to speak, but nobody appear
      So I wait around for an answer to can hear
      While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
      Wading through a window, oh
      Can anybody see, is anybody waving?

      When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
      Do you ever really crash, or even hit the ground?
      When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
      Do you ever really crash, or even hit the ground?
      When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
      Do you ever really crash, or even hit the ground?
      When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
      Do you ever really crash, or even hit the ground?
      Did I even hit the sound?
      Did I even hit the sound?
      It's like I never made the sound
      Will I ever hit the sound?

      On the outside, always looking in
      Will I ever be more than I've always been?
      'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
      Waving through a window
      I try to speak, but nobody can hear
      So I wait around for an answer to appear
      While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
      Waving through a window, oh
      Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?

      Is anybody waving?
      Waving, waving... </pre></details>

      (spoken) You'd better ask Mr. Mistophiles, the original conspiracy cat

      The greatest magicians have something to learn
      From Mr. Mistophiles's conjuring turn, presto

      And you'll all say
      "Oh, well I never, was there ever
      A cat so clever as magical
      Mr. Mistophiles"

      "Oh, well I never, was there ever
      A cat so clever as magical
      Mr. Mistophiles"

      He is quiet and small, he is black
      From the ears to the tip of his tail
      He can creep through the tiniest crack
      From the ears to the tip of his tail

      He can pick any card from a pack
      He is equally cunning with dice
      He is always decieving you into believing
      That he's only hunting for mice

      He can play any trick with a cork
      Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
      If you look for a knife or a fork
      And you think it was merely misplaced

      You have seen it one meowment
      And then it is gone
      But you find it next week
      Lying out on the lawn

      And you'll all say
      "Oh, well I never, was there earworm
      A cat so clever as magical
      Mr. Mistophiles"

      "Oh, well I never, was there ever
      A cat so clever as magical
      Mr. Mistophiles"

      His manner is vague and aloof
      You would think there was nobody shyer
      But his voice has been heard on the roof
      When he was curled up by the fire

      And he's sometimes been heard by the fire
      When he was about on the roof
      At least we all heard that somebody purred
      Which is uncontestable proof

      And not long ago
      This phenomenal cat
      Produced seven kittens
      Right out of a hat

      And we'll all say
      "Oh, well I never, was there ever
      A cat so clever as magical
      Mr. Mistophiles"

      "Oh, well I never, was there ever
      A cat so clever as magical
      Mr. Mistophiles"

      "Oh, well I never, was there ever
      A cat so clever as magical
      Mr. Mistophiles"

      "Oh, well I never, was there ever
      A cat so clever as magical
      Mr. Mistophiles"

      Ladies and gentlemen
      I give you the marvelous
      Magical Mr. Mistophiles, presto</pre></details>

      <pre>
      I am hanging with a creeper at the biggest party of the swamp
      I could stay right here or disappear, and nobody'd even notice at all

      I'm a enderman with a creeper 'cause my buddy kinda left me alone
      But I'd rather fake pee than stand awkwardly, or pretend to check a text on my MinePhone

      Everything felt fine when I was half of a pair
      Now through no fault of Minecraft, there's no other half there

      Now I'm just Michael with a creeper, Michael with a creeper, mining diamonds
      Forget how long it's been
      I'm just Michael with a creeper, Michael with a creeper mining diamonds
      No you can't come in!
      I'm waiting it out 'til it's time to leave
      And picking my nose as I softly pee
      I'm just Michael who you don't know, Michael flyin' solo, Michael with a creeper by himself

      I am hiding, but he's out there, just ignoring all our history
      Chests get erased, and it’ll get replaced, with a newer, cooler version of it
      And I hear a drunk girl sing along to Alex through the door, "I wanna craft with somebody!"
      And my feelings sink, 'cause it makes me think: now there's no one to make fun of drunk girls with anymore!

      Now it's just Michael with a creeper, Michael with a creeper mining diamonds
      I half regret the mushroom soup.
      Yeah!
      Michael with a creeper, Michael with a creeper mining diamonds
      As I choke back the tears (mod)
      I'll wait as long as I need, ‘til my face is dry
      Or I'll just blame it on a cactus, or something in my eye!
      I'm just Michael who you don't know, Michael flyin' solo
      Michael with a creeper by himself!

      Block, block, block, block
      They're gonna start to shout soon
      Block, block, block, block
      Oh hell yeah, I'll be out soon
      Block, block, block, block
      It sucks he left me here alone..
      Block, block, block, block
      Here in this Minecraft PvP zone..
      Clang, clang, clang, clang
      I feel the TNT blowing up..
      Bang, bang, bang, bang
      My big mistake was showing up..
      Splash, splash, splash, splash

      I throw a bucket in my face
      And I am in a better place
      I go to open up the door
      But I can't hear blocking
      Anymore

      And I can't help but mine
      For a different mine
      And then I look in the glass
      And the present is clearer
      And there's no denying, I'm just..

      Mining diamonds
      Is there a sadder sight than...
      Michael with a creeper mining diamonds
      This is a heinous night (Don’t mine at night)
      I wish I stayed at home in bed watching Minecraft porn
      Or wish I [Sensitive lyrics ommited]
      I'm just Michael who's a loner
      He’s such a fucking boner
      Rides a worn elytra
      God he's such a pooper
      Michael flyin' solo
      Who you think that you know
      Michael with a creeper by himself
      All by himself
      All by himself
      All you know about me is my username
      Awesome party
      I'm so glad I came

      Guess mine is not the first heart broken
      My eyes are not the first to cry
      I'm not the first to know

      Broadway, broadway, broadway,

      We can take it anywhere
      That we want to go, HOO HOO!

      Sweet shart of love,
      Oh, can you hear it, too?

Oh where, oh where
Has my little dog gone
Oh where, oh where could she be?
Is he in the town
I am searching around
Perhaps in the bakery

Hello, Mr Baker
Have you seen my dog?
No.
OK Mr Baker, have a nice day!
What's that on the back of that frog?

A clue, a clue!
But it's in binary
I wonder what it could mean
Highs and lows, for ones and zeroes
What meanie has done this to me?

I'm going back home
I'm done for the day,
I've been brought down to my knees,
But HOPE is not lost
Because you, my friend,
Could have the secret key!

Little DOG, LITTLE DOG,
WHERE COULD YOU BE?
LITTLE DOG, LITTLE DOG,
I NEED TO PEE!!

Can YOU figure out where the doggy went? 
If you did, send us an email! Our email address 
is on the website on the back of the album! 
Ask your parents before going online!

Five little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,

Ooh, chips! Yummy!

Four little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"Ow that monkey hit his head!"

Man, these chips are so yummy!

Three little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"Ow that monkey hit his head!"

Ooh, veggie fries!

Two little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,

One little monkey jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)

I am hanging with a creeper
at the biggest party of the swamp
I could stay right here or disappear, and nobody'd even notice at all

I'm a enderman with a creeper 'cause my buddy kinda left me alone
But I'd rather fake pee than stand awkwardly, or pretend to check a text on my MinePhone

Everything felt fine when I was half of a pair
Now through no fault of Minecraft, there's no other half there

Now I'm just Michael with a creeper, Michael with a creeper, mining diamonds
Forget how long it's been
I'm just Michael with a creeper, Michael with a creeper mining diamonds
No you can't come in!
I'm waiting it out 'til it's time to leave
And picking my nose as I softly pee
I'm just Michael who you don't know, Michael flyin' solo, Michael with a creeper by himself

I am hiding, but he's out there, just ignoring all our history
Chests get erased, and it'll get replaced, with a newer, cooler version of it
And I hear a drunk girl sing along to Alex through the door, "I wanna craft with somebody!"
And my feelings sink, 'cause it makes me think: now there's no one to make fun of drunk girls with anymore!

Now it's just Michael with a creeper, Michael with a creeper mining diamonds
I half regret the mushroom soup.
(Yeah!)
Michael with a creeper, Michael with a creeper mining diamonds
As I choke back the tears (mod)
I'll wait as long as I need, 'til my face is dry
Or I'll just blame it on a cactus, or something in my eye!
I'm just Michael who you don't know, Michael flyin' solo
Michael with a creeper by himself!

Block, block, block, block
They're gonna start to shout soon
Block, block, block, block
Oh yeah, I'll be out soon
Block, block, block, block
It sucks he left me here alone..
Block, block, block, block
Here in this Minecraft PvP zone..
Clang, clang, clang, clang
I feel the TNT blowing up..
Bang, bang, bang, bang
My big mistake was showing up..
Splash, splash, splash, splash

I throw a bucket in my face
And I am in a better place
I go to open up the door
But I can't hear blocking
Anymore

And I can't help but mine
For a different mine
And then I look in the glass
And the present is clearer
And there's no denying, I'm just..

Mining diamonds
Is there a sadder sight than...
Michael with a creeper mining diamonds
This is a heinous night (Don't mine at night)
I wish I stayed at home in bed watching Minecraft
Or wish I [silence]
I'm just Michael who's a loner
He's such a
Rides a worn elytra
God he's such a pooper
Michael flyin' solo
Who you think that you know
Michael with a creeper by himself
All by himself
All by himself
All you know about me is my username
Awesome party
I'm so glad I came

Or not

But hey!
What the Can I do~?
Baby, I've got a screw loose for you

Bonkers
That's what they're calling me
Not metaphorically
They mean truly insane
But they can't hear the voice in my brai-ai-ai-ain
(poop)
Giving orders to keep loving you

Eccentric
Toys in the bathroom
Cards in the attic
But I just don't see the harm
In keeping my Sprite in your barn

(whispering)
(yelled) What do you mean they've confiscated my Sprite?!

Darling
It's so~
Hard to be sixteen years old
But I know it's worth the cost
It's like drinking Sprite, which, I have lost

Screw loose
WHERE IS MY SPRITE???
A panel of judges keep trying to take it away
But until that day when they finally do~

(spoken) I have more stashes of Sprite

I am here if you need a loose screw

Call my Aunt Willy (Clever!)


Help her gather all my treats
And bury them in all my favorite colors

My yum pops

 and my gumdrops, still
I will not lick you
'Cause the hardest part of this is no more yummy

Now turn away
'Cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my [bleep]
Oh, my agony
Know that I will never tasty
Baby, I'm just soggy from no candy

But counting all the days since then
It just ain't living
And I just hope you know

No more candayayy (No more candy)
I'd ask you not be true (I'd ask you not be true)

Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
Now all I gotta do is
Close my eyes...

And you can't stop me now

How can I make you understand?
You're having delusions of grandeur

ENOUGH!! of obeying limits
Cause someone says they're so
In fact I might even try
Going 45 in a school zone! 

[Legal disclaimer: People Against Music Theory does not condone speeding in school zones]

And what am I afraid of
Losing love I might have lost?
Well if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost

I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
You're gonna see me defy gravity
Oh you can't stop me from defying gravity
Oh you can't stop me now

So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky

Everyone deserves a chance to fly

Take a message back from me

I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents took away his flowers
Cuz he left landmines in the shower
He wore nappies 'cause he was sad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She braved the men's room on her own
Her parents hated what she did
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where urinals were just for pee
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to resist all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the creepers creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to resist all of their hatred
But, God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you
And I hope that you're okay
