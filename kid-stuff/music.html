How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond
In the sky

Oh where, oh where
Has my little dog gone
Oh where, oh where could she be?
Is he in the town
I am searching around
Perhaps in the bakery

Hello, Mr Baker
Have you seen my dog?
No.
OK Mr Baker, have a nice day!
What's that on the back of that frog?

A clue, a clue!
But it's in binary
I wonder what it could mean
Highs and lows, for ones and zeroes
What meanie has done this to me?

I'm going back home
I'm done for the day,
I've been brought down to my knees,
But HOPE is not lost
Because you, my friend,
Could have the secret key!

Little DOG, LITTLE DOG,
WHERE COULD YOU BE?
LITTLE DOG, LITTLE DOG,
I NEED TO PEE!!

Can YOU figure out where the doggy went? 
If you did, send us an email! Our email address 
is on the website on the back of the album! 
Ask your parents before going online!

Sunny day, sweepin' up
Clouds away
On our way to where the air is sweet
Can you tell me how to get
How to get to Sesamie Street

Come and play, everything's
A-OK
Friendly neighbors there that's where we meet
Can you tell me how to get
How to get to Sesamie Street
How to get to Sesamie Street
How to get to Sesamie Street

The wheels on the bus go round and round
Round and round, round and round
The wheels on the bus go round and round
All through the town

The people on the bus go [nose blowing sound x3]
[nose blowing sound x3] [nose blowing sound x3]
The people on the bus go [nose blowing sound x3]
All through the town

The kids on the bus go YAY YAY YAYYY!!
YAY YAY YAYYY!! YAY YAY YAY!!
The kids on the bus go YAY YAY YAYYY!!
All through the town

The chickens on the bus go bawk bawk bawk
Bawk bawk bawk, bawk bawk bawk
The chickens on the bus go bawk bawk bawk
All through the town

The flowers on the bus go   
       
The flowers on the bus go   
All through the town

The moral of the story: You will meet many types of people on the bus, so it's important not to judge based on things one cannot change.</pre></details>

Five little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"Ow that monkey hit his head!"

Ooh, chips! Yummy!

Four little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"Ow that monkey hit his head!"

Man, these chips are so yummy!

Three little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"Ow that monkey hit his head!"

Ooh, veggie fries!

Two little monkeys jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"Ow that monkey hit his head!"

One little monkey jumping on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head (Oh no!)
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,
"No more monkeys jumpong on the bed"

Wow that was sad. 
Moral of the story is don't jump on the bed, I guess. 
Also chips are yummy.</pre></details>
